-  Just follow the very staight forward [tutotrial](https://binarin.ru/post/truly-reproducible-nixos/) , if you can manage that, without messing your nix-profile and in worst case entire system.



- Excerpts of Direction and Goals 



	Short term



What I want to use nix for



A- Trenchboot verifies boot ( works on NixOS /dev/TTYUSB0)



B- Coq verifies sel4( iirc)



C- Liquid types in Haskell let you define a theorem to verify your program and helps with maintenance



D - I want to build something like this for nix( in long run, as nix is flexible enough to let me,with its own quirks of typechecking , although I have seen and used tools to test flakes, when i was booting on tmpfs)
Using math for better developer experience, reliability and maintainability of nix on infra at scale




	Mid term



- Extend it for pine64, risc V and open hardware in general 





	Long term



- Use the infrastructure for a user governed , distributed network and data transfer 


	Feedback so far




> Bootstrapping and securing correctness is valuable and worthwhile attempting. I absolutely need buy-in from people who will have the moral and technical authority to merge my work


(Next steps ) sketching a technical outline and showing that to maintainers of the subsystems I  want to touch

-- Basically current slides are a lot like this git repo 




many branches , single contibutor and continuous commits. 



So not very presentable atm, Yet I am willing to share them to anyone who is curious and can help, guide or has feedbck on the above




and technical authority to merge my work
